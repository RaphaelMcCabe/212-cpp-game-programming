## Passing Criteria
- Commit regularly
  - A Clear Progression must be visible from your commits

  - This means that you need to do small iterative commits
    - add player sprite on screen

    - add gravity
    - refactored player into two classes
    - add health and healthbar
    - ...
- Use at least one Design Pattern
- 2+ Screenshots
- 1+ Video
- Description of the Game in the Readme
- Upload a Build of the Game

## Excellent Criteria
- The Code uses at least 2 Design Patterns
- The Code makes use of at least two advanced C++ Features such as
  - runtime polymorphism
  - compile-time polymorphism
  - concepts
  - function pointers
  - collections
- Adding to above: Those two advanced features solve a problem effectively
